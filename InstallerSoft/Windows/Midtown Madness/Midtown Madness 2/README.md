# Midtown Madness 2 Installer Warnings

## Start Menu and Control Panel programs:

After installing Midtown Madness 2, it may not appear in the start menu. This may be because your Windows Account is not Administrator or does not have the required permissions. For best compatability, it is highly recommended to install with Administrator permissions (right-click the file, then click "Run as Administrator")

For most users, it is best to use the NSIS installer. However we have provided the NSIS install script as well as the source in the form of *.zip and *.7z files, for any type of *sneaky viruses* that may lurk....(there aren't)
