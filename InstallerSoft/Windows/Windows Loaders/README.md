## Are they safe?

Any software downloaded from this repository is safe unless explicitely marked. The loaders *downloaded from this repository* are **safe and tested** (Okmeque1 and myself (GamerSoft24) are using it on our computers and have not been hacked).

> [!WARNING]
> 
> If you downloaded the loaders from another source apart from [`Okmeque1/Software`](https://github.com/Okmeque1/Software) or from [`massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts`](https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts), verify it is safe. With DAZ loader, the indicator at the top right of the application must be green. Otherwise, your version may be infected. With MAS loader, you'll have to check in the batch code within.
