# Windows Loaders

> [!WARNING]
>
> These loaders are unofficial and not supported by Microsoft. There is absolutely **NO WARRANTY**. We will ***not*** be liable for **any damages caused by the loaders in the `InstallerSoft/Windows/Windows Loaders` folder *in your possession! (this includes, but is not limited to, modification, execution or download of the files)***

## Are they safe?

Any software downloaded from this repository is safe unless explicitely marked, as said in our security policy. The loaders *downloaded from **this** repository* are **safe and tested** (Okmeque1 and myself (GamerSoft24) are using it on our computers and have not been hacked so far, it's been about 2-3 years or more).

> [!WARNING]
> 
> If you downloaded the loaders from another source apart from [`Okmeque1/Software`](https://github.com/Okmeque1/Software) or from [`massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts`](https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts), verify it is safe. With DAZ loader, the indicator at the top right of the application must be green. Otherwise, your version may be infected. With MAS loader, you'll have to check in the batch code within.
