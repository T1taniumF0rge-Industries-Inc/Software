# [`Software`] Repository

### ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ We have reached 1000 commits! -> *Next milestone 1500 commits?* ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ 

**REP-SET II**, *`Version 3.1.5b`*

## [`PySoft:`]
This is **where** I will be *storing all* of ***my and some of Okmeque1's*** Python codes and programs.

*For* **direct access**, [click here!](https://github.com/GamerSoft24/Software/tree/Main/PySoft)

## [`VBSoft:`]
This is **where** I will be *storing all* of ***my*** VBS (Windows Visual Basic Script) codes and programs.

> [!CAUTION]
> 
> The VBS codes are *more towards **pranks*** but Windows might detect it as a virus. Be careful though as the [`/VBSoft/Deadly`](https://github.com/GamerSoft24/Software/tree/Main/VBSoft/Deadly) folder, the codes there are actually ***deadly*** and can *crash your RAM* in just a **few seconds running.** We will ***not*** be liable for **any damages that any scripts in the `VBSoft` folder can potentially make *in your possession!***

## [`CPPSoft:`]

This is **where** I will be *storing all* of ***my*** C & C++ codes and programs although it's name is CPPSoft (C++ Software).

The codes will be more *focused* on **C++** rather then **C** and also there will be lots of codes working with external devices, like NodeMCU boards.

> [!TIP]
> 
> It is recommended to have [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) installed on your PC as a lot of programs will require it. Please check the ["Programs.md"](https://github.com/GamerSoft24/Software/blob/Main/Programs.md) file for informations about programs requiring Arduino IDE.

# Must-reads for `Software` Repository!

## InstallerSoft AV Virus Detections:

> [!WARNING]
>
> Some of our programs in the [`InstallerSoft/Windows`](https://github.com/GamerSoft24/Software/tree/Main/InstallerSoft) folder will report to most AV's as being viruses. However, unless a program is *explicitely* marked as a virus, you can trust this repository. Some installers will even come with *.nsi files so that you may check what the script is made out of, for any type of *sneaky* viruses. We will ***not*** be liable for **any damages any programs in the `InstallerSoft/Windows` folder can potentially make *in your possession!*** If you're not happy with this, then leave the repository.

## Amount of programming languages:

> [!NOTE]
>
> In GitHub, there is this section of the repository where it shows the amount of programming languages in percentages. However these may be incorrect, as some of our uploads in InstallerSoft and RepoSoft sometimes causes certain languages to rise and fall.
