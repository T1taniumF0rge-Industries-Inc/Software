> [!CAUTION]
> **/!\ ALL PERSONNEL AND MEMBERS MAY ENCOUNTER ERROR 404 TRYING TO ACCESS THIS REPOSITORY AS THIS REPOSITORY URL IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING. USE THE SEARCH FEATURE IN THE HOMEPAGE INSTEAD!**

### ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ We have reached 1701 commits!! -> *Next milestone 2000 commits!* ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ 

**REP-SET II**, *`Version 3.1.5b`*, *next update will occur soon after migration*

> [!NOTE]
> The ["Programs.md (program chart)"](https://github.com/T1taniumF0rge-Industries-Inc/Software/blob/Main/Programs.md) file has most but not every single resource available in the repository. Feel free to open an issue if you are unable to find what you want!

## [`PySoft:`]
This is **where** I and Okmeque1 will be *storing all* of ***our*** Python codes and programs.

*For* **direct access**, [click here!](https://github.com/T1taniumF0rge-Industries-Inc/Software/tree/Main/PySoft)

## [`VBSoft:`]
This is **where** I and Okmeque1 will be *storing all* of ***our*** VBS (Windows Visual Basic Script) codes and programs.

> [!CAUTION]
> 
> The VBS codes are *more towards **pranks*** but Windows/AntiVirus might detect it as a virus due to the nature of the files, however all VBS files not in the `/VBSoft/Deadly` folder should be safe to use. Be careful though as the [`/VBSoft/Deadly`](https://github.com/T1taniumF0rge-Industries-Inc/Software/tree/Main/VBSoft/Deadly) folder, the codes there are actually ***deadly*** and can *crash your RAM **and/or** your entire computer* in just a **few seconds of running.** We will ***not*** be liable for **any damages caused by any scripts in the `VBSoft` folder *in your possession! (this includes, but is not limited to, modification, execution or download of the files)***

## [`CPPSoft:`]

This is **where** I will be *storing all* of ***my*** C & C++ (including occasional C# & Objective-C) codes and programs although it's name is CPPSoft (C++ Software).

The codes will be more *focused* on **C++** rather then **the other languages of the C-family** and also there will be lots of codes working with external devices, like with NodeMCU boards.

> [!TIP]
> 
> It is recommended to have [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) installed on your PC as a lot of programs will require it. Please check the ["Programs.md"](https://github.com/T1taniumF0rge-Industries-Inc/Software/blob/Main/Programs.md) file for informations about programs requiring Arduino IDE.

# Must-reads for `Software` Repository!

## InstallerSoft AV Virus Detections:

> [!WARNING]
>
> Some of our programs in the [`InstallerSoft/Windows`](https://github.com/T1taniumF0rge-Industries-Inc/Software/tree/Main/InstallerSoft/Windows) folder may report to some AV's as being viruses (most likely in-house repackaged NSIS installers and other programs). However, unless a program is *explicitely* marked as a virus or a program that may crash your computer, you can trust this repository. Some installers will even come with *.nsi files and the source (usually in a *.zip file) so that you may check what the script is made out of, for any type of *sneaky* viruses. We will ***not*** be liable for **any damages caused by any programs in the `InstallerSoft/Windows` folder *in your possession! (this includes, but is not limited to, modification, execution or download of the files)***. You may choose to leave this repository if you do not feel comfortable with the above statement.

## Amount of programming languages:

> [!NOTE]
>
> In GitHub, there is this section of the repository where it shows the amount of programming languages in percentages. However these may be incorrect, as some of our uploads in InstallerSoft and RepoSoft sometimes causes certain languages to rise and fall.
