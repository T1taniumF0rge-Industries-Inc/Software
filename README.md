## VBSoft:
This is **where** I will be *storing all* of ***my*** VBS (Windows Visual Basic Script) codes and programs.

Be careful though as the [`/VBSoft/Deadly`](https://github.com/GamerSoft24/Software/tree/Main/VBSoft/Deadly) folder, the codes there are actually ***deadly*** and can *crash your RAM* in just a **few seconds running.**

## CPPSoft:

This is **where** I will be *storing all* of ***my*** C & C++ codes and programs although it's name is CPPSoft (C++ Software).

The codes will be more *focused* on **C++** rather then **C** and also there will be lots of codes working with external devices, like NodeMCU boards.

It is recommended to have [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) installed on your PC as a lot of programs will require it. Please check the ["Programs.md"](https://github.com/GamerSoft24/Software/blob/Main/Programs.md) file for informations about programs requiring Arduino IDE.

# Must-reads for `Software` Repository!

## ⚠️ Antivirus detection for InstallerSoft:

Some of our programs in the [`InstallerSoft/Windows`](https://github.com/GamerSoft24/Software/tree/Main/InstallerSoft) folder will report to most AV's as being viruses. However, unless a program is *explicitely* marked as a virus, you can trust this repository. Some installers will even come with *.nsi files so that you may check what the script is made out of, for any type of *sneaky* viruses. If you're not happy with this, then leave the repository.
