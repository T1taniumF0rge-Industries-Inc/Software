## IMPORTANT - GIT LFS FAILURE

> [!CAUTION]
>
> GIT LFS IS BROKEN AND WILL NOT CLONE! MAKE SURE TO UPDATE THE SPENDING AMOUNT SO THAT WE CAN KEEP WORKING ON THIS STUPID REPO!!!
>
> 
## Git LFS file size limitations:

> [!WARNING]
>
> Git LFS limits any individual file to 2GB, and if not respected then will throw error ` [422] Size must be less than or equal to 2147483648
`. This error will not disappear and mess up your pushes and pulls, and re-cloning the Git repository will be required.

## GitHub file size precautions:

> [!WARNING]
>
> If you try and upload a file that is over 100MB, make sure that the file extension type is correctly set in the .gitattributes file so that Git LFS can recognize the file as an LFS file and add the required pointers to point the file when the repository is getting cloned. Failure to do so will throw an error and usually (not always) mess up the commit history and file headers, and re-cloning the Git repository will potentially be required.
