# Password Manager - Database Edition

## Preface:

This password manager uses the `sqlite 3` databse module for python, and combined with the `cryptography` module, will provide a seamless password manager

## Features:

This password manager supports generating a password based on length, adding custom passwords, and generating custom generated passwords by choosing the amount of a single type of character, as well as being able to view and update current passwords. On top of that, it includes a built-in encryption module which ensures maximum security.
