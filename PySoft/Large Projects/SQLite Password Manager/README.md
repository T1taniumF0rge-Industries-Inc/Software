# Password Manager - Database Edition

## Preface:

This password manager uses the `sqlite 3` database module for python, and combined with the `cryptography` module, will provide a seamless password manager experience.

## Features:

This password manager supports generating a password based on length, adding custom passwords, and generating custom generated passwords by choosing the amount of a single type of character, as well as being able to view and update current passwords. On top of that, it includes a built-in encryption module which ensures maximum security.

## Prerequisites:

> [!NOTE]
>
> Please note that for this program to function correctly, the following modules need to be installed:
>   - `Cryptography`
>   - `sqlite3`
>   - `os`
>   - `random`
>
> The `cryptography` module is the one to install, as the other 3 should be installed by default if your Python version is over 3.10.** unless your interpreter didn't install correctly ***or*** if you installed your interpreter without administrator privileges.

Otherwise, you just need a standard Python 3.8 or newer interpreter with the option to import local python files as modules enabled.
