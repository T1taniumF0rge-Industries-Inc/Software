# Bugs Bunny

## Quick description

Bugs Bunny is a cartoon character created in the late 1930s at Warner Bros. Cartoons (originally Leon Schlesinger Productions) and voiced originally by Mel Blanc. Bugs is best known for his featured roles in the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of animated short films, produced by Warner Bros. 

Bugs is an anthropomorphic gray-and-white rabbit or hare who is characterized by his flippant, insouciant personality. He is also characterized by a Brooklyn accent, his portrayal as a trickster, and his catchphrase "Eh... What's up, doc?". Through his popularity during the golden age of American animation, Bugs became an American cultural icon and Warner Bros.' official mascot.

Note that this version includes French subtitles.

## File naming convention

The files are named from BB11 to BB31, and the decription or official name will be listed underneath. Not all of the videos will be in this collection.

For the highest video quality, VLC media player is recommended as it can handle formats like MKV and AVI, which are the file types used in this version.

The files starting with BB21 and BB24 will not be listed in this list as their file names already indicate their official name (ex: BB24 Rhapsody Rabbit will not be in the list since Rhapsody Rabbit is the official name of the video)

BB31 12.AVI is corrupted due to a bad file transfer and will only show half the video. Using VLC for this file is highly recommended as it can build a file index to make skipping smoother.
