You can inspect what was checked out with 'git status'
and retry with 'git restore --source=HEAD :/'
```

This error is known to happen, and you will have to wait until either the next Git LFS package is paid by the repository owner or the Git LFS budget is reset or disactivated.

## Git Pull Errors:

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Before you leave your computer for any reason, make sure to push the last files that you have committed, otherwise you may encounter problems when pulling or pushing new files (git merge problems) and may have to reclone the entire repository again (just hope your suppresion of the file doesnt take ages).

## Git LFS file size limitations:

> [!WARNING]
>
> Git LFS limits any individual file to 2GB, and if not respected then will throw error 422 ` [422] Size must be less than or equal to 2147483648
`. This error will not disappear and mess up your pushes and pulls, and re-cloning the Git repository will be required.

## GitHub file size precautions:

> [!CAUTION]
>
> If you try and upload a file that is over 100MB, make sure that the file extension type is correctly set in the .gitattributes file so that Git LFS can recognize the file as an LFS file and add the required pointers to point the file when the repository is getting cloned. Failure to do so will throw an error and usually (not always) mess up the commit history and file headers, and re-cloning the Git repository will potentially be required.

## Windows File Sharing recommendations:

> [!TIP]
>
> While not really repository focused, if you are trying to setup a file share with the sharing machine being a Windows 10 computer, make sure to enable all permissions and disable most security features to ensure compatability and that you create or move the files into the shared directory **AFTER** having shared the folder. Failure to do so will result in other computers throwing permission errors and failure to read the shared folder contents.

## Linux boot failure on G31 (2007) era systems:

Most if all Linux distributions will fail to load a GUI after the initial loading process due to an auto-detection bug that causes wrong graphics parameters to be loaded that older BIOS cannot support. The temporary fix is to go into the boot menu of Linux (should show your distro name and other options) and select the main distro and press E. This will open the options flags. Find the line that starts with `linux` and add to the end of that line `nomodeset acpi=off` which will force super old VESA drivers which are guaranteed to work.

For a permanent solution, it is recommended to find proper video drivers, failing that you could always patch the GRUB bootloader.
