# Server Error:

## Why have I been redirected here?

You have been redirected to this page due to an error in the server. This measure is taken to improve customer satisfaction and reduce confusion. If you were in the middle of doing anything with the repository, your data may be unsaved and lost.

## Possible Causes?

1 -> A feature is under implementation and not ready. Please read the ["Programs.md"](https://github.com/GamerSoft24/Software/blob/Main/Programs.md) file and/or the `Software` repository's [commit log](https://github.com/GamerSoft24/Software/commits) for more information.

2 -> An attacker is pretending to be [this](https://github.com/GamerSoft24/Software) website but our protection measures have detected this intercepted attack and redirected you here. No data has been sent as we have stopped the outgoing connection before any data was exchanged.

3 -> A feature was recently removed. Please read the ["Programs.md"](https://github.com/GamerSoft24/Software/blob/Main/Programs.md) file and/or the `Software` repository's [commit log](https://github.com/GamerSoft24/Software/commits) for more information.

4 -> A restriction to [this](https://github.com/GamerSoft24/Software) website has been added to the network, and our protection measures rely on passing data to the server. This block between the client and the server can cause our protection measures to fail the test and send you back. If you need access to this website, please contact your administrator for access.

## What should I do?

If you think you can proceed elsewhere, you may. Attacks like these can be temporary and don't happen all the time.
