# Code Contributing Guidelines

To consider *changing programs and codes* in this `Software` repository you have to **pull request first and wait for approval** which should be *reviewed* in the **maximum delay of ***7 days***** **unless** the repository is in inactive mode (located in the README file)! The 'Pull requests' tab is located on the top left corner of your screen (on computer), most generally under the word Software.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### The new code must meet these basic guidelines:
>
> - The person who changes it must clearly mark what they changed through any means (code comments, start of programs or in program descriptions in the programs)
> - It must follow a similar style of the original code (example: Rewriting [Security Management System](https://github.com/GamerSoft24/Software/blob/Main/PySoft/Utilities/security%20management%20system.py) in classes and imports module would most likely get rejected because this program uses while, input and print clauses, if you want to do that then you can copy the program onto your own fork of this repository and change it.)
> - The new version of the file must still include the original copyright names and symbols, however you may still mention your username on any new code.
> - The new code must function properly including handling edge cases and malformed inputs, as well as not breaking the existing unchanged code
>
> ### Some things to take note about:
>
> - The workflows in this repository may not work properly. It is expected to have workflow failures on each commit. If this happens, just ignore it.
> - If this repository is in inactive mode, the code may not get reviewed until 6 months of a pull request being opened.
> - You may want to add new languages to the repo (for now, we don't have official BASH scripts, but if you wanted you could create a new folder named BASHSoft and go from there making your own BASH scripts)
> - For individual small files, it is best to use the web editor as this repository will take about 30 minutes on average to clone using Git BASH, since this repo is 35.6GB on a local computer.
> - If you still want to use Git BASH, it is highly recommended to use the [Developer File Area](/devs.md) to avoid any potential failure
