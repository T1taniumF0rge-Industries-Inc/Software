## Required Librairies

Librairies are basically add-ons for python programs. Say you wanted a GUI for a given program. Then you must install the module 'tkinter'. 

To install a module, navigate to the folder where PYTHON.EXE is located. To do this, press the Windows button then start typing 'Python'. You should see 'PYTHON.EXE' or 'Python' with the word 'app'. Right click, then open file location. Copy the file location into a command prompt as pip(the module installer) only works in a command line. You will then run the command from the python location 'cd Scripts'. You have now changed directory. Then to install, run 'pip install {pip install name}'. Keep in mind this does need an internet connection!

For pip to function properly and install correctly, you must do `pip install {PIP INSTALL NAME}` as it is the name of the module that pip knows.

For all programs to function, you must have :
