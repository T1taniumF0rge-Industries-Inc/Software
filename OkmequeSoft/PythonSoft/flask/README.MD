# PythonSoft Flask folder

# Intro

This is the flaskk folder, where all HTML and flask applications will be located, and not science experiments. You can experiment with these but to run them, you will need a virtual environmentby doing venv\Scripts\activate in PowerShell

Next to run the flask application, you will need to do flask --app Filename.py run. If there is a problem, you can enable debugging by adding --debug to the end of the previous command.
